  <h1 align="center"> Job Management</h1>
   <br>
  <p>Based on an employee management system, this site has the function that an employer can have control over their employees, adding more people to their    company, generating jobs and being able to update data at any time. Features a dark mode interface and focus systems on interactive features. The project was built on    Front-end HTML, CSS and JavaScript Vanilla technologies.

   <p>In this project an API created by @ValterGabriel was used for storage and rest resources.</p>
