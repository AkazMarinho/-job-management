  <h1 align="center"> Job Management</h1>
   <br>
  <p>Based on an employee management system, this site has the function that an employer can have control over their employees, adding more people to their    company, generating jobs and being able to update data at any time. Features a dark mode interface and focus systems on interactive features. The project was built on    Front-end HTML, CSS and JavaScript Vanilla technologies.
  </p>
  
   <p>In this project an API created by @ValterGabriel was used for storage and rest resources.</p>

   <h2>Login Page</h2>
   <p>The login page has basic functionalities, with validation through the CNPJ and the employer's password, and already has the functionality of choosing the visualization mode.</p>

  <h2>Home Page</h2>
  <p> The homepage follows most of the important paths on the site. The header contains the exit, light/dark mode and user profile icons, and will accompany all pages on the site, as well as the footer, which contains the company's contact information.</p>

  <p>Colors in light mode (by preference, I kept the images in dark mode).</p>

  <h2>Create Employee</h2>

  <p>On the employee creation page, the person's data will be placed and sent to a database through API rest commands, which will be accessed in the future.</p>

  <h2>List Employee</h2>
  <p>Based on the employees added, this page will show a list with all the names, emails and whether they are active or not, and editing feature.</p>

  <h2>Search system</h2>
  <p>Within the page that lists employees, there is a functional search system.</p>
  <p>In this example, a search is made for the letter H, and only the names that contain the letter are shown.</p>

  <h2>Employee update</h2>

  <h2>Create job</h2>
  
  <p>On this page, jobs related to an employee can be created with a simple form, adding a name, description and completion date. That job will be visible in the job list and can be edited or deleted later.</p>

  <h2>Responsive menu</h2>
  <p>The top menu already has changes in responsiveness, and can take on a hamburger format when on smaller devices.</p>

  <h2>Validation and dark/light modes via local storage</h2>
  <p>The API does not have its own authentication system, and to give more reality to the system as a whole, an authentication system was implemented through local storage. Data is received and persisted across pages. If the data is entered incorrectly in the login, the other pages cannot be accessed correctly, where there will be no transaction with the back-end, and no data will be received or sent.</p>
  <p>The project also has a light/dark mode system, and user preferences are persistent even after closing the browser.</p>
